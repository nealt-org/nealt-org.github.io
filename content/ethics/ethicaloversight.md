### Policy on consent to publication

All persons named in a publication must be aware of the publication's existence and have consented to their name being used in connection with the publication. This includes offering them a copy of the final manuscript (minus other people's names) to review, so that they can give informed consent over what they are being named in.

### Policy on research on vulnerable populations

Research on vulnerable populations is in general only welcome at NoDaLiDa if a member of that population has been included in the design and conduct of the research in an authoritative position, and also receives prominent placement in the authorship list, commensurate with their contribution. Research on vulnerable populations that was not conducted in collaboration with researcher from those populations should not be submitted to NoDaLiDa.
